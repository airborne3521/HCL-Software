For example, if a user browses the public (unauthenticated) part of a website, it can usually be done without having to provide the user with a cookie (at least not a cookie containing login credentials or other private information). When the user decides to go into an area of the website where authentication is needed they enter their credentials into a login page and are then given a session cookie. This session cookie should only stick with this user while they are within the authenticated portion of the website. Once they logout or visit the public portion of the website, the session cookie should not be sent to their browser. This will limit the effect of any type of cookie stealing attacks.\\nThe recommendations are: By setting the `path` attribute to the path of the non-public (authenticated) area of the web site, an attacker is limited to where and when they can steal the session cookie., {@code_bad:\\n<script language=\"javascript\">\\n...\\n   var c = Cookie.write(\\'user\\', value, {path: \\'/myapp/secure/shopping/\\'});\\n...\\n</script>\\n:code}\\n',\n"," 'Authentication.Credentials.Unprotected_javascript_8ec7f89a.article.json': 'The causes are: The `$.ajax(options)` method contains a hard-coded user name and/or password.

The `manifest` attribute is set to a string value indicating the manifest cache file name. When present in a web page, the `manifest` attribute causes the browser to cache some or all of the application\\'s server resources on the client.

This file is broken up into three sections:, * CACHE MANIFEST - Identifies which server resources will be available offline., * NETWORK - Identifies which server resources will not be available offline., * FALLBACK - Identifies which server resources will be replaced with a local resource when the application is operating offline., It is important when caching resources to make sure that the client is connected to the correct servers when downloading resources into a client side cache. Connecting to an untrusted network or a proxy controlled by an attacker could allow resources controlled by the attacker to be cached on the client side., Additionally, if the server is vulnerable to web based injection attacks and has been compromised, the server resources could already contain an attacker\\'s injected code. if these compromised server resources are cached locally on a client, the attacks become persistent. To remove the persistent threat, the client side cache will need to be fully purged., Finally, caching sensitive data on a client can open up the application to threats of data theft. If the client is a mobile device or laptop that contains sensitive unencrypted cached data, and that mobile device or laptop is stolen, the attacker can potentially gain access to the cache and view the sensitive information.\\nThe recommendations are: It is recommended that to prevent exploitation of cached information, that the `manifest` attribute be removed., {@code_bad:\\n<html>\\n:code}, Once this attribute is removed all locally cached files will be purged.\\n',\n"," 'AccessControl.Bypass_javascript_847489f4.article.json': 'The causes are: The use of one or more of the following JQuery methods indicate that some type of AJAX mechanism is being used to converse with the web server:, * `$.ajax()`, * `$.get()`, * `$.getJSON()`, * `$.getScript()`, * `$.post()`, * `$(selector).load()`, When adding AJAX calls to your application you should keep in mind that AJAX may be opening up other types of vulnerabilities within your application.

Since the origins match, the content in the `<iframe>` has access to the top-level web page\\'s context., Fortunately, HTML5 `<iframe>` elements now have a new `sandbox` attribute that can be used to protect the top-level web page from hosted `<iframe>` content. To apply this new attribute to an `<iframe>` element simply add it as an empty attribute as shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"\" >\\n:code}, This attribute, as shown in this example, prevents the following:, * The `<form>` HTML element is not allowed to submit content., * JavaScript is disabled., * Plug-ins cannot be accessed., * The mouse pointer lock cannot be accessed., * The `seamless` and `autofocus` attributes, among others are ignored., * The hosted content in the `<iframe>` will not have access to the top-level web page even if the origin of the top-level web page and the content hosted in the `<iframe>` have the exact same origin., * Content hosted in the `<iframe>` cannot target any other browsing context but its own. That is, code such as `window.top.location` that accesses the top-level web page, will have no effect., The `sandbox` attribute essentially is used to disallow certain privileged operations. Conversely, it can also be used to allow certain privileged operations by assigning specific values, such as `allow-top-navigation` to this attribute. This is shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"allow-top-navigation\" >\\n:code}, The `allow-top-navigation` value will allow the hosted content of the `<iframe>` to navigate the top-level web page in order to replace its contents or load a resource.\\nThe recommendations are: The `allow-top-navigation` value has been set in the `sandbox` attribute of the `<iframe>` element on this top-level web page. This will loosen the security restrictions on this `<iframe>` element. In this case, `allow-top-navigation` will enable code such as `window.top.location` to modify the top-level web page contents., Verify that this functionality is permissible and necessary. If it is not, remove the `allow-top-navigation` value from the `sandbox` attribute., {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"\" >\\n:code}\\n',\n"," 'CrossSiteScripting_javascript_1816f0e0.article.json': 'The causes are: In the era of Web 2.0, a greater number of websites are incorporating Adobe Flash to provide a better user experience.

This will loosen the security restrictions on this `<iframe>` element. In this case, `allow-forms` will enable web `<form>` elements hosted in this `<iframe>` element to submit their contents to their target server., Verify that this functionality is permissible and necessary.

For a more in depth look at this type of attack see the References section below for links to relevant information. The Side Jacking attack is typically used to steal cookies that are then cloned and replayed to the target website allowing the attacker to log in as the victim. Even if the web site uses HTTPS as its protocol, an attacker can still force the session cookie to be sent in an unencrypted (HTTP) connection. To mitigate this attack the session cookie is sent with the `secure` attribute. This attribute forces the cookie to only be sent to the client when there is a secure connection (HTTPS)., The problem is that a typical web page downloads various resources such as JavaScript (.js) files and Cascading StyleSheets (.css) files from the web site. These files are typically send via unsecured connections (HTTP) for performance reasons., {@code_bad:\\n<script src=\"http://www.example.com/dosomething.js\" />\\n:code}, An attacker can take advantage of this by sniffing the network for these files, intercept them and then inject code in them or rewrite them in order to steal the session cookie. The injected JavaScript is then executed by the victim and the cookie that was sent over the secure connection can then be stolen. For more details on how this is accomplished see the blog entry \"Surf Jacking Secure Cookies\" in the References section below.\\nThe recommendations are: Add the `HTTPOnly` flag on the cookie. This will prevent client-side script from accessing the cookie. Note that not all browsers support the `HTTPOnly` flag., Additionally, any resources accessed through script tags could be accessed only through a secure connection (HTTPS).

The `<iframe>` element allows a web page or web page fragment from the same or a different domain to be embedded within the main web page that is being viewed in the browser. The `<iframe>` element makes it easier to host 3rd party web content, embed widgets on a web page, create mash-ups of information from disparate web sites, among other things., Unfortunately, in most cases, your web site developers will not have control over the content hosted in an `<iframe>`. If the 3rd party web content hosted in the `<iframe>` is manipulated by an attacker, the `<iframe>` will not prevent the manipulated content from being rendered and any embedded script from being executed. While the same-origin policy will prevent many attacks from succeeding, it is not a panacea. Phishing, pop-ups, plug-in manipulation, drive-by-download attacks and data pilfering are some of the potential attacks that can be attempted from content hosted in an `<iframe>` element., Note, however, that the same-origin policy will not restrict content hosted in an `<iframe>` that has the same origin as the top-level web page hosting the `<iframe>`. Since the origins match, the content in the `<iframe>` has access to the top-level web page\\'s context., Fortunately, HTML5 `<iframe>` elements now have a new `sandbox` attribute that can be used to protect the top-level web page from hosted `<iframe>` content. To apply this new attribute to an `<iframe>` element simply add it as an empty attribute as shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"\" >\\n:code}, This attribute, as shown in this example, prevents the following:, * The `<form>` HTML element is not allowed to submit content., * JavaScript is disabled., * Plug-ins cannot be accessed., * The mouse pointer lock cannot be accessed., * The `seamless` and `autofocus` attributes, among others are ignored., * The hosted content in the `<iframe>` will not have access to the top-level web page even if the origin of the top-level web page and the content hosted in the `<iframe>` have the exact same origin., * Content hosted in the `<iframe>` cannot target any other browsing context but its own. That is, code such as `window.top.location` that accesses the top-level web page, will have no effect., The `sandbox` attribute essentially is used to disallow certain privileged operations. Conversely, it can also be used to allow certain privileged operations by assigning specific values, such as `allow-scripts` to this attribute. This is shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" >\\n:code}, The `allow-scripts` value will allow the execution of JavaScript within the hosted content of the `<iframe>`.\\nThe recommendations are: The `allow-scripts` value has been set in the `sandbox` attribute of the `<iframe>` element on this top-level web page. This will loosen the security restrictions on this `<iframe>` element. In this case, `allow-scripts` will enable JavaScript to execute in this `<iframe>` element., Verify that this functionality is permissible and necessary.

From the server\\'s point of view, the `XmlHttpRequest` object is a source of tainted data. Data originating from user input or from 3rd party sources are passed along to the server through this object. While data originating from the web server (either your application\\'s web server or a 3rd parties web server), and possibly a database server, will be returned to the client via the callback specified in the `XmlHttpRequest` object.

The second argument defines the target domain to which the message argument is sent. This second argument can accept either a domain, in the form of a URI, or a \\'*\\' character. If a domain is passed into this argument, the message will be sent only to that domain.

Additionally, HTML sanitization is hard to get right and even the most popular and actively developed sanitizers have vulnerabilities discovered from time to time. By leaving the sanitization outside of this library it gives users the ability to patch and deploy any fixes needed immediately instead of having to wait for a new version of this library to be released with the fix., Using it with img might work well, but better avoid and use your own function to sanitize HTML., {@code_bad:\\nvar data = myHTMLSanitizer(<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(\\'xss\\')\" />);\\n            function App() {\\n    \\t\\t\\treturn (<div>{data} </div>;);\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n:code}\\n',\n"," 'Communications.SSL_React Native_31f9e641.article.json': 'The causes are: HTTPS traffic potentially can be intercepted by installing malicious CA certificates on a mobile device.

A single Cross Site Scripting flaw in the sending page allows an attacker to send messages of any given format.\\n\",\n"," '  * Both pages should only interpret the exchanged messages as **data**. Never evaluate passed messages as code (e.g. via `eval()`) or insert it to a page DOM (e.g. via `innerHTML`), as that would create a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. For more information see DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.\\n',\n"," '  * To assign the data value to an element, instead of using a insecure method like `element.innerHTML=data;`, use the safer option: `element.textContent=data;`\\n',\n"," '  * Check the origin properly exactly to match the FQDN(s) you expect. Note that the following code: `if(message.origin.indexOf(\".owasp.org\")!=-1) { /* ... */ }` is very insecure and will not have the desired behavior as `owasp.org.attacker.com` will match.\\n',\n"," '  * If you need to embed external content/untrusted gadgets and allow user-controlled scripts (which is highly discouraged), please check the information on sandboxed frames.\\n',\n"," '\\n',\n"," '### Cross Origin Resource Sharing\\n',\n"," '\\n',\n"," '  * Validate URLs passed to `XMLHttpRequest.open`. Current browsers allow these URLs to be cross domain; this behavior can lead to code injection by a remote attacker. Pay extra attention to absolute URLs.\\n',\n"," \"  * Ensure that URLs responding with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` do not include any sensitive content or information that might aid attacker in further attacks. Use the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header only on chosen URLs that need to be accessed cross-domain. Don't use the header for the whole domain.\\n\",\n"," '  * Allow only selected, trusted domains in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Prefer allowing specific domains over blocking or allowing any domain (do not use `*` wildcard nor blindly return the `Origin` header content without any checks).\\n',\n"," \"  * Keep in mind that CORS does not prevent the requested data from going to an unauthorized location. It's still important for the server to perform usual CSRF prevention.\\n\",\n"," '  * While the Fetch Standard recommends a pre-flight request with the `OPTIONS` verb, current implementations might not perform this request, so it\\'s important that \"ordinary\" (`GET` and `POST`) requests perform any access control necessary.\\n',\n"," '  * Discard requests received over plain HTTP with HTTPS origins to prevent mixed content bugs.\\n',\n"," \"  * Don't rely only on the Origin header for Access Control checks. Browser always sends this header in CORS requests, but may be spoofed outside the browser. Application-level protocols should be used to protect sensitive data.\\n\",\n"," '\\n',\n"," '### WebSockets\\n',\n"," '\\n',\n"," '  * Drop backward compatibility in implemented client/servers and use only protocol versions above hybi-00. Popular Hixie-76 version (hiby-00) and older are outdated and insecure.\\n',\n"," '  * The recommended version supported in latest versions of all current browsers is RFC 6455 (supported by Firefox 11+, Chrome 16+, Safari 6, Opera 12.50, and IE10).\\n',\n"," \"  * While it's relatively easy to tunnel TCP services through WebSockets (e.g. VNC, FTP), doing so enables access to these tunneled services for the in-browser attacker in case of a Cross Site Scripting attack. These services might also be called directly from a malicious page or program.\\n\",\n"," \"  * The protocol doesn't handle authorization and/or authentication. Application-level protocols should handle that separately in case sensitive data is being transferred.\\n\",\n"," \"  * Process the messages received by the websocket as data. Don't try to assign it directly to the DOM nor evaluate as code. If the response is JSON, never use the insecure `eval()` function; use the safe option JSON.parse() instead.\\n\",\n"," '  * Endpoints exposed through the `ws://` protocol are easily reversible to plain text. Only `wss://` (WebSockets over SSL/TLS) should be used for protection against Man-In-The-Middle attacks.\\n',\n"," '  * Spoofing the client is possible outside a browser, so the WebSockets server should be able to handle incorrect/malicious input. Always validate input coming from the remote site, as it might have been altered.\\n',\n"," '  * When implementing servers, check the `Origin:` header in the Websockets handshake. Though it might be spoofed outside a browser, browsers always add the Origin of the page that initiated the Websockets connection.\\n',\n"," '  * As a WebSockets client in a browser is accessible through JavaScript calls, all Websockets communication can be spoofed or hijacked through Cross Site Scripting. Always validate data coming through a WebSockets connection.\\n',\n"," '\\n',\n"," '### Server-Sent Events\\n',\n"," '\\n',\n"," '  * Validate URLs passed to the `EventSource` constructor, even though only same-origin URLs are allowed.\\n',\n"," '  * As mentioned before, process the messages (`event.data`) as data and never evaluate the content as HTML or script code.\\n',\n"," '  * Always check the origin attribute of the message (`event.origin`) to ensure the message is coming from a trusted domain.
