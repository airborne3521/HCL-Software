For example, if a user browses the public (unauthenticated) part of a website, it can usually be done without having to provide the user with a cookie (at least not a cookie containing login credentials or other private information). When the user decides to go into an area of the website where authentication is needed they enter their credentials into a login page and are then given a session cookie. This session cookie should only stick with this user while they are within the authenticated portion of the website. Once they logout or visit the public portion of the website, the session cookie should not be sent to their browser. This will limit the effect of any type of cookie stealing attacks.\\nThe recommendations are: By setting the `path` attribute to the path of the non-public (authenticated) area of the web site, an attacker is limited to where and when they can steal the session cookie., {@code_bad:\\n<script language=\"javascript\">\\n...\\n   var c = Cookie.write(\\'user\\', value, {path: \\'/myapp/secure/shopping/\\'});\\n...\\n</script>\\n:code}\\n',\n",

The `manifest` attribute is set to a string value indicating the manifest cache file name. When present in a web page, the `manifest` attribute causes the browser to cache some or all of the application\\'s server resources on the client. This allows for faster access to web resources that do not change often as well as offline access to remote resources and less work for the web server to handle., The following code forces the web application to use the manifest cache file to determine which server resources to cache under which conditions:, {@code_bad:\\n<html manifest=\"TestApp.appcache\">\\n:code}, The manifest cache file defined by the `manifest` attribute contains information specific to how the cache mechanism will operate and which web resources will be cached. This file is broken up into three sections:, * CACHE MANIFEST - Identifies which server resources will be available offline., * NETWORK - Identifies which server resources will not be available offline., * FALLBACK - Identifies which server resources will be replaced with a local resource when the application is operating offline., It is important when caching resources to make sure that the client is connected to the correct servers when downloading resources into a client side cache. Connecting to an untrusted network or a proxy controlled by an attacker could allow resources controlled by the attacker to be cached on the client side., Additionally, if the server is vulnerable to web based injection attacks and has been compromised, the server resources could already contain an attacker\\'s injected code. if these compromised server resources are cached locally on a client, the attacks become persistent. To remove the persistent threat, the client side cache will need to be fully purged., Finally, caching sensitive data on a client can open up the application to threats of data theft. If the client is a mobile device or laptop that contains sensitive unencrypted cached data, and that mobile device or laptop is stolen, the attacker can potentially gain access to the cache and view the sensitive information.\\nThe recommendations are: It is recommended that to prevent exploitation of cached information, that the `manifest` attribute be removed., {@code_bad:\\n<html>\\n:code}, Once this attribute is removed all locally cached files will be purged.\\n',\n",

The `<iframe>` element allows a web page or web page fragment from the same or a different domain to be embedded within the main web page that is being viewed in the browser. The `<iframe>` element makes it easier to host 3rd party web content, embed widgets on a web page, create mash-ups of information from disparate web sites, among other things., Unfortunately, in most cases, your web site developers will not have control over the content hosted in an `<iframe>`. If the 3rd party web content hosted in the `<iframe>` is manipulated by an attacker, the `<iframe>` will not prevent the manipulated content from being rendered and any embedded script from being executed. While the same-origin policy will prevent many attacks from succeeding, it is not a panacea. Phishing, pop-ups, plug-in manipulation, drive-by-download attacks and data pilfering are some of the potential attacks that can be attempted from content hosted in an `<iframe>` element., Note, however, that the same-origin policy will not restrict content hosted in an `<iframe>` that has the same origin as the top-level web page hosting the `<iframe>`. Since the origins match, the content in the `<iframe>` has access to the top-level web page\\'s context., Fortunately, HTML5 `<iframe>` elements now have a new `sandbox` attribute that can be used to protect the top-level web page from hosted `<iframe>` content. To apply this new attribute to an `<iframe>` element simply add it as an empty attribute as shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"\" >\\n:code}, This attribute, as shown in this example, prevents the following:, * The `<form>` HTML element is not allowed to submit content., * JavaScript is disabled., * Plug-ins cannot be accessed., * The mouse pointer lock cannot be accessed., * The `seamless` and `autofocus` attributes, among others are ignored., * The hosted content in the `<iframe>` will not have access to the top-level web page even if the origin of the top-level web page and the content hosted in the `<iframe>` have the exact same origin., * Content hosted in the `<iframe>` cannot target any other browsing context but its own. That is, code such as `window.top.location` that accesses the top-level web page, will have no effect., The `sandbox` attribute essentially is used to disallow certain privileged operations. Conversely, it can also be used to allow certain privileged operations by assigning specific values, such as `allow-forms` to this attribute. This is shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"allow-forms\" >\\n:code}, The `allow-forms` value will allow web `<form>` to submit their content from the `<iframe>`.\\nThe recommendations are: The `allow-forms` value has been set in the `sandbox` attribute of the `<iframe>` element on this top-level web page. This will loosen the security restrictions on this `<iframe>` element. In this case, `allow-forms` will enable web `<form>` elements hosted in this `<iframe>` element to submit their contents to their target server., Verify that this functionality is permissible and necessary. If it is not, remove the `allow-forms` value from the `sandbox` attribute., {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"\" >\\n:code}\\n',\n",

For a more in depth look at this type of attack see the References section below for links to relevant information. The Side Jacking attack is typically used to steal cookies that are then cloned and replayed to the target website allowing the attacker to log in as the victim. Even if the web site uses HTTPS as its protocol, an attacker can still force the session cookie to be sent in an unencrypted (HTTP) connection. To mitigate this attack the session cookie is sent with the `secure` attribute. This attribute forces the cookie to only be sent to the client when there is a secure connection (HTTPS)., The problem is that a typical web page downloads various resources such as JavaScript (.js) files and Cascading StyleSheets (.css) files from the web site. These files are typically send via unsecured connections (HTTP) for performance reasons., {@code_bad:\\n<script src=\"http://www.example.com/dosomething.js\" />\\n:code}, An attacker can take advantage of this by sniffing the network for these files, intercept them and then inject code in them or rewrite them in order to steal the session cookie. The injected JavaScript is then executed by the victim and the cookie that was sent over the secure connection can then be stolen. For more details on how this is accomplished see the blog entry \"Surf Jacking Secure Cookies\" in the References section below.\\nThe recommendations are: Add the `HTTPOnly` flag on the cookie. This will prevent client-side script from accessing the cookie. Note that not all browsers support the `HTTPOnly` flag., Additionally, any resources accessed through script tags could be accessed only through a secure connection (HTTPS).

The `<iframe>` element allows a web page or web page fragment from the same or a different domain to be embedded within the main web page that is being viewed in the browser. The `<iframe>` element makes it easier to host 3rd party web content, embed widgets on a web page, create mash-ups of information from disparate web sites, among other things., Unfortunately, in most cases, your web site developers will not have control over the content hosted in an `<iframe>`. If the 3rd party web content hosted in the `<iframe>` is manipulated by an attacker, the `<iframe>` will not prevent the manipulated content from being rendered and any embedded script from being executed. While the same-origin policy will prevent many attacks from succeeding, it is not a panacea. Phishing, pop-ups, plug-in manipulation, drive-by-download attacks and data pilfering are some of the potential attacks that can be attempted from content hosted in an `<iframe>` element., Note, however, that the same-origin policy will not restrict content hosted in an `<iframe>` that has the same origin as the top-level web page hosting the `<iframe>`. Since the origins match, the content in the `<iframe>` has access to the top-level web page\\'s context., Fortunately, HTML5 `<iframe>` elements now have a new `sandbox` attribute that can be used to protect the top-level web page from hosted `<iframe>` content. To apply this new attribute to an `<iframe>` element simply add it as an empty attribute as shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"\" >\\n:code}, This attribute, as shown in this example, prevents the following:, * The `<form>` HTML element is not allowed to submit content., * JavaScript is disabled., * Plug-ins cannot be accessed., * The mouse pointer lock cannot be accessed., * The `seamless` and `autofocus` attributes, among others are ignored., * The hosted content in the `<iframe>` will not have access to the top-level web page even if the origin of the top-level web page and the content hosted in the `<iframe>` have the exact same origin., * Content hosted in the `<iframe>` cannot target any other browsing context but its own. That is, code such as `window.top.location` that accesses the top-level web page, will have no effect., The `sandbox` attribute essentially is used to disallow certain privileged operations. Conversely, it can also be used to allow certain privileged operations by assigning specific values, such as `allow-scripts` to this attribute. This is shown in the following example:, {@code_bad:\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.example.com\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" >\\n:code}, The `allow-scripts` value will allow the execution of JavaScript within the hosted content of the `<iframe>`.\\nThe recommendations are: The `allow-scripts` value has been set in the `sandbox` attribute of the `<iframe>` element on this top-level web page.

From the server\\'s point of view, the `XmlHttpRequest` object is a source of tainted data. Data originating from user input or from 3rd party sources are passed along to the server through this object. While data originating from the web server (either your application\\'s web server or a 3rd parties web server), and possibly a database server, will be returned to the client via the callback specified in the `XmlHttpRequest` object. This callback can now be considered as a source of tainted data from the client\\'s point of view.

Input validation is necessary to ensure the integrity of the dynamic data of the application. \"Validation\" is useful to protect against \"cross-site, \"SQL, \"command and corrupt application data fields., {@code_bad:\\nvar express = require(\\'express\\');\\nvar app = express();\\n\\napp.get(\\'/\\', function(req, res){\\n\\tres.send(\\'id: \\' + req.query.id);\\n});\\n:code}\\nThe recommendations are: Validate user input to match the expectations for that input field. For example, all date fields should be of the same format, which is published to the user. In addition, name fields and other text fields should be limited to an appropriate characterset, no special characters, with expected minimum and maximum sizes., In this example we use the NodeJS package `validator` to validate the user input with the `matches` method using a regular expression., {@code_bad:\\nvar express = require(\\'express\\');\\nvar app = express();\\n\\napp.get(\\'/\\', function(req, res){\\n   validator.matches(req.query.id,/[\\\\w\\\\d]{40}/);\\n\\tres.send(\\'id: \\' + req.query.id);\\n});\\n:code}\\n',\n",

Docker image builds are inconsistent. Just like we’re using `lockfiles` to get a deterministic `npm install` behavior every time we install npm packages, we’d also like to get deterministic docker image builds. If we build the image from node—which effectively means the `node:latest` tag—then every build will pull a newly built Docker image of `node`. We don’t want to introduce this sort of non-deterministic behavior.\\n2. The node Docker image is based on a full-fledged operating system, full of libraries and tools that you may or may not need to run your Node.js web application. This has two downsides.

An orchestration engine, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or even just Docker engine itself, needs a way to send signals to the process in the container. Mostly, these are signals to terminate an application, such as `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL`.\\n2. The process may run indirectly, and if that happens then it’s not always guaranteed that it will receive these signals.\\n3. The Linux kernel treats processes that run as process ID 1 (PID) differently than any other process ID.\\n\\nEquipped with that knowledge, let’s begin investigating the ways of invoking\\nthe process for a container, starting off with the example from the Dockerfile\\nwe’re building:\\n\\n**`CMD \"npm\" \"start\"`**\\n\\nThe caveat here is two fold. Firstly, we’re indirectly running the node\\napplication by directly invoking the npm client. Who’s to say that the npm CLI\\nforwards all events to the node runtime? It actually doesn’t, and we can\\neasily test that.\\n\\nMake sure that in your Node.js application you set an event handler for the\\n`SIGHUP` signal which logs to the console every time you’re sending an event.\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 57}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '1e6638e6a9840ce3a57e32a9436594cc'}>,\n",

That’s because the npm client doesn’t forward any\\nsignals to the node process that it spawned.\\n\\nThe other caveat has to do with the different ways in which way you can\\nspecify the `CMD` directive in the Dockerfile. There are two ways, and they\\nare not the same:\\n\\n1. the shellform notation, in which the container spawns a shell interpreter that wraps the process. In such cases, the shell may not properly forward signals to your process.\\n2. the execform notation, which directly spawns a process without wrapping it in a shell.

It occurs due to missing access control\\nchecks, which fail to verify whether a user should be allowed to access\\nspecific data.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nFor instance, when a user accesses their profile, the application might\\ngenerate a URL like this:\\n\\n`https://example.org/users/123`\\n\\nThe 123 in the URL is a direct reference to the user's record in the database,\\noften represented by the primary key. If an attacker changes this number to\\n124 and gains access to another user's information, the application is\\nvulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference. This happens because the app\\ndidn't properly check if the user had permission to view data for user 124\\nbefore displaying it.\\n\\nIn some cases, the identifier may not be in the URL, but rather in the POST\\nbody, as shown in the following example:\\n\\n```\\n\\nUpdate Profile\\n\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the application allows users to update their profiles by\\nsubmitting a form with the user ID in a hidden field. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 112}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '5da9b6dc8fda7d35bc305429eb0bbc7c'}>,\n",

However, even with\\ncomplex identifiers, access control checks are essential. If attackers obtain\\nURLs for unauthorized objects, the application should still block their access\\nattempts.\\n\\n## Mitigation\\n\\nTo mitigate IDOR, implement access control checks for each object that users\\ntry to access. Web frameworks often provide ways to facilitate this.\\nAdditionally, use complex identifiers as a defense-in-depth measure, but\\nremember that access control is crucial even with these identifiers.\\n\\nAvoid exposing identifiers in URLs and POST bodies if possible. Instead,\\ndetermine the currently authenticated user from session information. When\\nusing multi-step flows, pass identifiers in the session to prevent tampering.\\n\\nWhen looking up objects based on primary keys, use datasets that users have\\naccess to.

See the Secrets Management Cheat Sheet for more information.\\n* Version control - Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Ensure all the changes to the IaC are tracked with the right set of information that helps in any revert operation. The important part is that you’re checking in those changes alongside the features they support and not separately. A feature’s infrastructure requirements should be a part of a feature’s branch or merge request. Git is generally used as the source code version control system.\\n* Principle of least privilege - define the access management policies based on the principle of least privilege with the following priority items:\\n\\n* Defining who is and is not authorized to create/update/run/delete the scripts and inventory.\\n* Limiting the permissions of authorized IaC users to what is necessary to perform their tasks.

CI/CD may be decomposed into two distinct parts: continuous\\nintegration (CI) and continuous delivery and/or continuous deployment (CD).

For example, when synchronizer tokens or custom HTTP request\\nheaders are used, the JavaScript program will include them in the asynchronous\\nrequests. Also, web browsers will include cookies in same-site request\\ncontexts initiated by JavaScript programs, circumventing the SameSite cookie\\npolicies.\\n\\n**Client-Side vs. Classical CSRF:** In the classical CSRF model, the server-\\nside program is the most vulnerable component, because it cannot distinguish\\nwhether the incoming authenticated request was performed **intentionally** ,\\nalso known as the confused deputy problem.

Since this vulnerability is based on the core\\nmechanism of modern web browsers, it's also called a browser side-channel\\nattack. XS-Leaks attacks seek to exploit the fact of seemingly insignificant\\ninformation that is exchanged in cross-site communications between sites. This\\ninformation infers answers to the previously asked questions about the\\nvictim's user account. Please take a look at the examples provided below:\\n\\n* Is the user currently logged in?\\n* Is the user ID 1337?\\n* Is the user an administrator?\\n* Does the user have a person with a particular email address in their contact list?\\n\\nOn the basis of such questions, the attacker might try to deduce the answers,\\ndepending on the application's context. In most cases, the answers will be in\\nbinary form (yes or no).

A few key aspects:\\n\\n* Two URLs are considered as **same-origin** if their **protocol** , **port** , and **host** are the same\\n* Any origin can send a request to another source, but due to the Same-origin Policy, they will not be able to read the response directly\\n* Same Origin Policy may be relaxed by Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).\\n\\n| Origin A | Origin B | Same origin? | | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | | `https://example.com` | `http://sub.example.com` | No, different hosts | | `https://example.com` | `https://example.com:443` | Yes! \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 499}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '6c3751b9675798d1db64efdfc37f6381'}>,\n",

The SameSite attribute takes\\nthe following values:\\n\\n* `None` \\\\- the cookie will be attached to a request from another site, but it must be sent over a secure HTTPS channel\\n* `Lax` \\\\- the cookie will be appended to the request from another page if the request method is GET and the request is made to top-level navigation (i.e. the navigation changes the address in the browser top bar)\\n* `Strict` \\\\- the cookie will never be sent from another site\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning here the attitude of Chromium based browsers in which\\ncookies without SameSite attribute set by default are treated as Lax.\\n\\nSameSite cookies are a strong **defense-in-depth** mechanism against **some**\\nclasses of XS Leaks and CSRF attacks, which can significantly reduce the\\nattack surface, but may not completely cut them (see, e.g.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 500}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '47e21901bba1e2210d18ffc968b5eea9'}>,\n",

A\\nlogout can thus be \\'simulated\\' by clearing the JWT from session storage. If\\nthe user chooses to close the browser instead, then both the cookie and\\nsessionStorage are cleared automatically.\\n\\nAnother way to protect against this is to implement a token denylist that will\\nbe used to mimic the \"logout\" feature that exists with traditional session\\nmanagement system.\\n\\nThe denylist will keep a digest (SHA-256 encoded in HEX) of the token with a\\nrevocation date.

This is the most common form of\\nMFA, and is often used in conjunction with passwords. The most common types of\\npossession-based authentication are hardware and software tokens, and digital\\ncertificates. If properly implemented then this can be significantly more\\ndifficult for a remote attacker to compromise; however it also creates an\\nadditional administrative burden on the user, as they must keep the\\nauthentication factor with them whenever they wish to use it.\\n\\n### One Time Password Tokens\\n\\nOne Time Password (OTP) tokens are a form of possession-based authentication,\\nwhere the user is required to submit a constantly changing numeric code in\\norder to authenticate. The most common of which is Time-based One Time\\nPassword (TOTP) tokens, which can be both hardware and software based.\\n\\n#### Hardware OTP Tokens\\n\\nHardware OTP Tokens generate a constantly changing numeric codes, which must\\nbe submitted when authenticating.

While REST\\nis more widely applicable, it is most commonly used within the context of\\ncommunicating with services via HTTP.\\n\\nThe key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. A REST API resource\\nis identified by a URI, usually a HTTP URL. REST components use connectors to\\nperform actions on a resource by using a representation to capture the current\\nor intended state of the resource and transferring that representation.\\n\\nThe primary connector types are client and server, secondary connectors\\ninclude cache, resolver and tunnel.\\n\\nREST APIs are stateless. Stateful APIs do not adhere to the REST architectural\\nstyle. State in the REST acronym refers to the state of the resource which the\\nAPI accesses, not the state of a session within which the API is called.

XSS attacks are serious and can lead to account impersonation,\\nobserving user behaviour, loading external content, stealing sensitive data,\\nand more.\\n\\n**This cheatsheet contains techniques to prevent or limit the impact of XSS.\\nSince no single technique will solve XSS, using the right combination of\\ndefensive techniques will be necessary to prevent XSS.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.844391057915604, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1155}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'cd71913db2d2fb7172f248062f93f0ed'}>,\n",
